<h1><a href="https://github.lamurakami.com">LAMurakami GitHub Pages</a></h1>
      
<h2 id="404">404 Not Found!</h2>

<h3 id="file-not-found">File not found</h3>

<p>The requested page was not found.</p>

<p>If this is a directory without a static index page try the
<img src="/icons/back.gif" alt="[PARENTDIR]">
<a href="..">Parent Directory</a></p>

<p>Some of the other reasons why this error message could appear include:</p>

<ul><li>The GitHub repo Settings have "None" for the Source parameter
 in the GitHub Pages section so the page is Not published.

<li>The URL or its content (such as files or images) was either deleted or moved
 (without adjusting any internal links accordingly).

<li>The URL was written incorrectly (during the creation process or a redesign),
 linked incorrectly, or typed into the browser incorrectly.

<li>The server responsible for the website is not running or the connection is broken.

<li>The requested domain name can't be converted to an IP by the domain name system (DNS).

<li>The entered domain name doesn't exist (anymore).
</ul>

<p>Links that don't lead anywhere are known as 'dead links' or 'broken links'.
Dead links are often left for long periods of time since operators have no idea that the
 linked content has been deleted or moved. Many websites still appear in the search engine
 results pages even though they aren't available online anymore (or at least not at the
 specified URL). Other linked websites such as blogs, news portals, etc. are often not
 informed that the site has been removed or can now be found under a new URL. Many website
 operators don't check their external links regularly and therefore a functioning link
 could easily become a dead one.</p>
