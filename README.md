## Welcome to the [LAMurakami GitHub Pages](https://github.lamurakami.com)

On Saturday, May 30, 2020 after creating the repository and selecting one of the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) Themes I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LAMurakami/lamurakami.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to update the README.md Markdown file for this new site.  I then linked it to [LAM Sites](http://sites.lam1.us).  I continued on with some of the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics) topics including Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

I initially found that Enforce HTTPS was Not yet available and then saw that a certificate for [github.lamurakami.com](https://github.lamurakami.com) good for 90 days was generated within minutes.  This makes [github.lamurakami.com](https://github.lamurakami.com) my first website that does not use a self generated certificate that is automatically branded as untrusted by most browsers.

### Markdown

[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is the lightweight and default syntax for styling GitHub writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
### Jekyll Themes

This Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/LAMurakami/lamurakami.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.  I am new to Jekyll and was not particularly happy with any of the 10 or so themes I briefly examined.
