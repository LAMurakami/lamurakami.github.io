## The [LAMurakami GitHub Pages](https://github.lamurakami.com) repository

On Saturday, May 30, 2020 after creating the repository and selecting one of the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) Themes I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LAMurakami/lamurakami.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to update the README.md Markdown file for this new site.  I then linked it to [LAM Sites](http://sites.lam1.us).  I continued on with some of the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics) topics including Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

I initially found that Enforce HTTPS was Not yet available and then saw that a certificate for [github.lamurakami.com](https://github.lamurakami.com) good for 90 days was generated within minutes.  This makes [github.lamurakami.com](https://github.lamurakami.com) my first website that does not use a self generated certificate that is automatically branded as untrusted by most browsers.
