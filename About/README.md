## The [LAMurakami GitHub Pages](https://github.lamurakami.com) About page

The LAMurakami GitHub User was created in 2015 the same year I retired from the <a href="http://arsc.lam1.us/About">Arctic Region Supercomputing Center</a>.  Git was not around until the last 1/3 of my Computer Analyst/Programmer/Consultant/Specialist career and when I did use it for work it was with private repositories rather than GitHub.  Five years after my retirement I first started investigating GitHub Pages.  After creating the [lamurakami.github.io repository](https://github.lamurakami.com) for the User GitHub pages I used a couple of old repositories so I had GitHub Pages sites published from a /docs directory in the main branch and a gh-pages branch as well as from the master branch root used in the User GitHub Pages.

This README.md was created primarily to link to the LAMurakami GitHub Pages About page content in the index.html of this directory.
